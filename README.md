**Course objectives and outcome**

_Objectives_

The objective of this course is to provide students 
with the fundamental elements of machine learning security in the context of different application domains. 
The main concepts and methods of adversarial machine 
learning are presented, from threat modeling to attacks and defenses, 
as well as basic methods to properly evaluate adversarial robustness 
of a machine learning model against different attacks.
 
_Outcome_

An understanding of fundamental concepts and methods of machine learning security and its applications. 
An ability to analyse and evaluate attacks and defenses in the context of application-specific domains. 
An ability to design and evaluate robust machine learning models with Python and test them on benchmark data sets.
