    "# Evasion attacks against Machine Learning models\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](\n",
    "https://colab.research.google.com/github/unica-mlsec/mlsec/blob/HEAD/labs/02_evasion_attacks.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in class, machine learning models can be fooled by *adversarial examples*, samples artificially crafted to redirect the output of the victim towards a desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "These attacks can be either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **targeted**, in which the attacker wants to produce a specific misclassification (e.g. a dog must be recognized as a cat); or\n",
    "* **untargeted**, in which the attacker is satisfied with producing a generic misclassification (e.g. a dog will be recognized as anything else but a dog).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both targeted and untargeted attacks are formulated as optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Targeted attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Targeted attacks that can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\min_\\boldsymbol{\\delta} L(\\boldsymbol{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}, y_t; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n",
    "  \\\\\n",

    "  \\\\\n",
    "  \\text{subject to} \\quad \\boldsymbol{l}_b \\preccurlyeq \\boldsymbol{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta} \\preccurlyeq \\boldsymbol{l}_u\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ is the objective function of our attack (it defines the goal of the attacker, *i.e.*, where to find adversarial examples), $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is the sample to perturb, $y_t$ is the target label, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ are the parameters of the model, $\\epsilon$ is the maximum allowed perturbation, and $\\boldsymbol{l}_b,\\boldsymbol{l}_u$ are the input-space bounds (for instance, images must be clipped in 0-1 or 0-255 to be valid samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Untargeted attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Untargeted attacks can be formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\max_\\boldsymbol{\\delta} L(\\boldsymbol{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}, y; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n",
    "  \\\\\n",
    "  s.t.\\quad ||\\delta||_p \\le \\epsilon\n",
    "  \\\\\n",
    "  \\text{subject to} \\quad \\boldsymbol{l}_b \\preccurlyeq \\boldsymbol{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta} \\preccurlyeq \\boldsymbol{l}_u\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we change the minimization to a *maximization*, since we want to maximize the error of the classifier w.r.t. the real label $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by implementing *untargeted* evasion attacks, and we need to define two main components: the *optimization algorithm* and the *loss function* of the attack. While the second one can be *any* distance function, we will now describe one particular optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will leverage the *projected gradient descent* [1,2] optimizer, by implementing it step by step in SecML.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create a simple 2D dataset that we will use in this tutorial, and we fit an SVM classifier on top of it.\n",

    "At each iteration, the strategy computes the gradient of the model, and it updates the adversarial example by following the computed direction.\n",
